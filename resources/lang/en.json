    "ke7"  :  "By understanding the economic calendar, you can make your strategy one step ahead. For example, when an event coded red, such as the release of interest rate data from the central bank, will be released on Thursday, then you can estimate when you have to close your position before the data is actually released to the public.",
    "ke8"  :  "Many traders choose to close positions 3-5 minutes before the data release. Since the data release is scheduled and predictable, this is common practice.",
    "ke9"  :  "Apart from that, by looking at the economic calendar, you can prepare for better risk management. If X happens, then market movements will be like this and there is a possibility of a certain percentage loss. The amount of loss you can bear if the market price fluctuates rapidly. Don't forget to set a stop loss as well.",
    "ke10"  :  "Not all traders use the economic calendar as a reference because they are satisfied with other economic indicators. Apart from that, the economic calendar also has many choices, it all depends on the needs of the trader whether what he trades is in direct contact with the news that will be released or not. By because of that the type of information on the trading calendar will be different from one another.",
    "ke11"  : "After knowing what and how important the economic calendar is in trading, of course you have to be more open and always updated with developments in world politics before determining a position in the market. For those of you who want to try to make a strategy using the economic calendar, you can start with a demo account at PT Mentari Mulia Berjangka and try to trade gradually from small lots to large lots while honing your trading skills.",
